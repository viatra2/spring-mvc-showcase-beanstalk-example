This is the fork of the original showcase from https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-mvc-showcase.

The only change is that the project imported to IDEA to demonstrate how to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk Integration plugin for this project deployment.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk Integration plugin can be downloaded from http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7274
